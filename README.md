# Towards distilling 'physical laws' in heterogeneous catalysis with symbolic regression

Present-day catalyst development is mainly driven by empiricism, which, to some extent, limits the exploration of many more exciting catalysts. Nevertheless, developing novel catalysts often requires exploring a high-dimensional chemical space; this usually involves a combination of chemical information and extensive statistical analysis. Advances in machine learning (ML) have enabled the rapid yet accurate predictions of target properties. However, many ML models failed to interpret and provide actionable insights into future catalyst design. Symbolic regression (SR) is an interpretable ML method for building mathematical expressions that describe the algebraic relations amongst the parameters from the input datasets. In this work, SR is used to extract “physicial laws” to aid the design of Ni-N4 single-atom catalysts and oxide catalysts. Both of these demonstrate the practicality of SR for guiding future catalyst formulation and experimental design.
